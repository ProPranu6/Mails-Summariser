Greetings Ma'am I'm Praneeth Thota of CSE B, AP19110010207.
Firstly congrats on your paper submission ma'am.
Ma'am I have some queries regarding the assignment titled "Project Problem Statement".
Ma'am in the partial description of this assignment certain details pertaining to sensor node distribution, energies and packet attributes are given.
And also we are asked to simulate the sending of 5 packets from each sensory node to the sink.
However no routing protocols, or radio ranges for the sensory nodes or manipulation of energies for each packet transmission from node to node are given yet since this is just a primary stage of a main project.
So given the limited details, I simulated an unreal packet transmission which follows neither radio ranges nor any routing protocols.
My query here is, when I only have partial information about the project can I also state my problem statement accordingly?
Meaning, can I state a problem statement about just the first stage unreal simulation I made that doesn't encompass any routing protocols and other specifics?
And can I submit this partial simulation now and still modify it later further down the semester when all the concepts are known and not be graded until the final submission is made?
Please enlighten me about what are necessary components and what are frills at this stage of submission so that I can submit accordingly.
