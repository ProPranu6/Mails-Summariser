Greetings Ma'am I'm Praneeth Thota of CSE B, AP19110010207.
Firstly congrats on your paper submission ma'am.
Ma'am in the partial description of this assignment certain details pertaining to sensor node distribution, energies and packet attributes are given.
However no routing protocols, or radio ranges for the sensory nodes or manipulation of energies for each packet transmission from node to node are given yet since this is just a primary stage of a main project.
So given the limited details, I simulated an unreal packet transmission which follows neither radio ranges nor any routing protocols.
Meaning, can I state a problem statement about just the first stage unreal simulation I made that doesn't encompass any routing protocols and other specifics?
And can I submit this partial simulation now and still modify it later further down the semester when all the concepts are known and not be graded until the final submission is made?
