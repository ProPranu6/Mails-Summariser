Dear Sir, Good Morning, sir, I'm Praneeth Thota AP19110010207 again, as mentioned in my previous email, we (my groupmates and I) are eagerly awaiting a confirmation concerning this cross-discipline research activity(involving both AIML and IoT), so that we could plan for our internship accordingly and in time.
We are completely aware of your busy schedule and hence wanted to post this reminder mail so that it gets convenient for you to reply.
Hope you would understand our situation and eagerly waiting to hear from you Regards On Tue, May 25, 2021 at PM Thota Venkata Saai Praneeth .
