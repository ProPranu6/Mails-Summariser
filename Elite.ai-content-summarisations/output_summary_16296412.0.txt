Once a famous British Politician named Benjamin Disraeli said, “There can be an economy only where there is efficiency”. As utility is what decides value and value is what drives an economy, it’s simple to deduce that efficiency in economics is all about being able to produce greater quantities of goods , and to do that with minimal resources. So, when there is this question that when an entity possesses absolute advantage over the production of certain goods in comparison with some other entity can a trade still exist between them, Richardo was able to see something that could motivate a trade in this situation which is opportunity cost. An opportunity cost is something that needs to be given up to acquire something else. It is what decides what to trade and what not to. For instance, let’s picturise a hypothetical situation wherein two countries one, country A, capable of producing either 1000 tanks of gasoline or 500 gold biscuits in an hour and the other, country B, capable of producing 100 tanks of gasoline or 200 gold biscuits in the same hours time. Clearly, country A has an absolute advantage over productions of either gasoline or gold biscuits compared to country B. However, there is still something that country A can do to enhance their economic prosperity which also enhances the economic status of country B. In case of a domestic trade, country A can have a maximum production of 1000 units, (that of gasoline), in an hour. Here the opportunity cost of producing a tank of gasoline is 2 gold biscuits to country B while it is just 0.5 gold biscuit to country A. Putting this in simple words, country A has less to lose compared to country B in producing the gasoline. Conversely, country B can produce gold biscuits at a cheaper opportunity cost compared to country A. This is what is termed as comparative advantage.
