Dear All, Good morning and Happy Teachers' Day!
The auspicious celebration of "Teachers' Day" originated to commemorate the birthday of Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, former President of India, by acknowledging the contributions of teachers- the best minds of the country.
We must salute Dr Radhakrishnan and remember his words of wisdom that "the end-product of education should be a free creative man, who can battle against historical circumstances and adversities of nature."
